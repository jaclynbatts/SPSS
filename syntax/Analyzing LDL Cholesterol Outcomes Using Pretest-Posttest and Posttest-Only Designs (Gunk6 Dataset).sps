*This SPSS syntax analyzes LDL cholesterol outcomes from the Gunk6.sav dataset using both pretest-posttest and posttest-only control group designs. The analyses include:

Filtering treatment group participants for one-group pretest-posttest comparisons.
McNemarâ€™s test to evaluate changes in binary LDL status (high vs. not high) before and after the intervention.
Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test to compare ordinal LDL categories pre- and post-intervention within the treatment group.
Chi-square test for posttest-only comparisons between treatment and control groups on LDL status.
Mann-Whitney U test to assess post-intervention ordinal LDL category differences by treatment group.
